            Grand Theft Auto VI’s price has seemingly leaked online and if you found yourself outraged by the recent reveal of the pricing of Mario Kart World, you’re probably not going to like what I have to say next.It was just last week that Nintendo held its hugely successful Nintendo Switch 2 Direct which, safe to say, left us all positively hyped.

            That was until the showcase ended and we saw how much everything unveiled would cost. Currently, Nintendo Switch games hold a top RRP of £59.99; that’s due to rise to £74.99 for the upcoming day one launch Mario Kart World, if you purchase the game physicallyIt’s a move that’s upset many but, of course, not all.

            Some argue that a family-friendly game shouldn’t be that out-of-reach for so many would-be players; others say that this simply brings Nintendo’s pricing in line with that of Xbox and PlayStationThere’s also now the very real concern that maybe analysts previously weren’t too far wrong in suggesting that Rockstar Games’ GTA VI could charge $100.
It is the most anticipated game of all-time so if £74.99 is the new top-end rate, you can understand why some may think it’ll slip above that.
Well, the game’s price has reportedly just surfaced on one retailer’s website.
