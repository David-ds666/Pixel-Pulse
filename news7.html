      <h1 class="news-title">The Global Impact of a US TikTok Ban </h1>

            A potential TikTok ban is on the horizon as the United States Supreme Court considers an important decision this week. This case has implications that extend beyond the US and a single app. It affects the security and livelihoods of millions and raises concerns about the future of a free and open Internet. This action could establish a troubling precedent, undermining the principles of a globally connected Internet—one that is open, secure, and trustworthy.

            The Internet Society has repeatedly warned that banning online services and apps splinters the Internet and can be dangerous. It’s a counterproductive global trend that threatens national security, economies, and personal safety. The aims of such bans can often be accomplished in other ways with less collateral damage.

            The US government claims a ban is necessary for national security reasons. There are legitimate concerns, including data security and potential manipulation of feeds. Investigations found TikTok employees misused journalists’ data and mishandled sensitive financial data on creators and advertisers. The app’s parent company suppressed political and other sensitive content and influence operations have been identified.
