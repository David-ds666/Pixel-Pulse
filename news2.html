            The Samsung Galaxy S26 has broken cover at last, so we can finally take a good look at what Samsung's flagship phone offering for 2026 can do for us.

        <p>
            Galaxy Unpacked has revealed that, as expected, there are three models in total: the S26, S26 Plus and S26 Ultra. This page will be focusing on the S26 and S26 Plus, with the Galaxy S26 Ultra getting a page of its own due to its unique characteristics.
        </p>

            Compared to the Galaxy S25, the Galaxy S26 beefs up the performance and memory while adding lots of new software to play with via the One UI 7 OS update and fresh Galaxy AI features. The price has stayed the same as last year too, which should keep these phones among the best Android phones and best phones overall that we've tested to date.
